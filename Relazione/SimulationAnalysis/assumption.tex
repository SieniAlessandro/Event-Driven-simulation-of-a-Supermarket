\subsection{A priori assumption}
\paragraph{} 
The assumption made to have a good model to study the behavior of the system is the following:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The system has ideal  delay = 0 s among all the network nodes and in case a) a fixed delay equal to $\Delta \cdot j$
	\item Queue hasn't a maximum size, all customers that enter the system will be served
	\item The system at simTime zero is empty
	\item Distributions of inter-arrival time (IAT) and service time (ST) are independent from the workload
	\item The pseudo-random numbers generated in the simulation by Omnet can be considered IID
\end{enumerate}
In order to model the system is  under the hypothesis of continuous-time Markov Chains \[M/M/C/\infty/\infty\] where:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item C is finite because the number of tills can variate, but stay constant in a single simulation
	\item The queue is infinite because the tills can serve all the people.
	\item The population is infinite because before the simulation we donâ€™t know how many people will arrive at each till.
\end{enumerate}

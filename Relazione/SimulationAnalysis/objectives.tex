\subsection{Objectives}
\paragraph{}
Our general objective is to evaluate the performance of the two different types of tail. It’s obtained by comparing the queueing and response time of two options under a varying workload. We want to analyze the variation of:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the time spent in the queue, 
	\item the response time of the till,
\end{enumerate}
assuming that there is a deterministic (predetermited) delay to reach the till from the queue that is: \[\Delta \cdot j\] 
where j is the till’s number. To minimize this delay it was decided that the till's IDs are representative of the distance between queue and till ------- VERIFICATE CHE VI PIACCIA PIU' DI QUESTA To minimize this delay it was decided that to schedule the case decision algorithm (in such a way that the cash box with the lowest ID is chosen) so that choice is the case with smaller ID (SCEGLI FRASE MIGLIORE IN INGLESE PER DIRE QUESTA COSA). 
\paragraph{} Evaluation will be done observing the behaviour of the system, varying the workload and the number of tills. We are interested in finding the scenario with better queuing time and response time. 
Our objective is SMART because it’s specific (comparing times), measurable (fulfill in a finite time interval), achievable (it’s happen every day), repeatable (experiments can be repeated as often as necessary) and thorough.

\section{Scenario Analysis}
\paragraph{}
In this project, for each suitable configuration we have selected different seeds, one for each run. This action has been implemented on inter-arrival time of customers and service time, having a different seed for each run is necessary for the idea of IIDness. Seeds represent inter-arrival rate for the queue and service rate for the till. Each queue and each till have a different seed. Moreover, all statistical data are extracted from the simulator when it is in the steady state, where the parameters of interest has shown relatively constant behaviour. In general, high utilization and lowest delay and queuing time is always the case of interest, since the arrival rate and service rate, $\lambda$ and $\mu$, can lead to the overbalance of people in the system, that would cause too long waiting times. These two parameter has been the point of debate which helped us finding more suitable configurations and more accurate system limits. It is possible to have a same utilization by having different values of parameters e.g. increasing arrival time and decreasing service time, but this is not suitable for the logic of the supermarket.

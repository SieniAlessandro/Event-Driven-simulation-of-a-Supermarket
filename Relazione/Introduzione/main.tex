\section*{\centering{Introduction}}
\paragraph{} Our project consists in a supermarket with two types of queue: single and multiple. Customers arrive with a IID RVs interarrival time and their service demands are IID RVs and could be exponential or lognormal. Interarrival time is exponential. The number of tills is constant in a single simulation, but varies between different simulations. When a custumer arrives is directed to a queue (single or multiple). After the queueing time the customer is served if we are in the case of multiple queue; otherwise if we are in case of single queue, a deterministic time \[\Delta \cdot j\] is added at the total response time. In the end the customer is served and leaves the supermarket.
